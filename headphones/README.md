# 📄 Web Page Clone from Figma Design

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project is a **pixel-perfect implementation** of a responsive and accessible webpage based on a UI design created by **Nicolas Philippot**, a professional UI/UX designer. The final result is built **from scratch using only HTML and CSS** — **no JavaScript or external CSS libraries** (e.g., Bootstrap) are used.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in:
- Semantic HTML
- CSS layout and styling
- Responsive design principles
- Accessibility best practices
- Recreating a design using Figma as the source of truth
